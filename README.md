This repo is for processing the Zooplankton data collected from S FL MBON cruises in the FL keys so that it can be published to OBIS as a Darwin Core Archive.

The data is segmented annually.

## data processing steps
1. collect the data using the sheets (TODO: link the raw data collection spreadsheets here
2. run the relevant scripts to convert the collection sheets into a DwC archive
3. upload to OBIS via one of the [IPT](https://github.com/gbif/ipt) nodes listed [here](http://ipt.iobis.org/) (Caribbean?).
